Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sethu Manikkam, a Software Engineer who loves building reliable and efficient backend systems. Iâ€™m passionate about solving problems with clean, scalable code and enjoy creating APIs that power seamless user experiences.

Iâ€™ve got hands-on experience with both backend and frontend development. On the backend, I work with .NET Core, Django, FastAPI, and Flask, and Iâ€™m also skilled in databases like MSSQL and PostgreSQL. On the frontend, Iâ€™m comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

Right now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into .NET Core to strengthen my skills, but Iâ€™m always excited to explore and learn new tools and frameworks. Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from building secure RESTful APIs to ensuring HIPAA compliance for enterprise applications.

I love collaborating with teamsâ€”whether itâ€™s developers, designers, or product ownersâ€”and translating ideas into working solutions. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering products that not only work well but are also enjoyable to use.

Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects and contribute to innovative teams. Feel free to check out my work here or connect with meâ€”Iâ€™d love to chat about tech or work on something cool together!
